# Changelog

All notable Boot project changes are recorded here.

This changelog tracks the Infiltrator project itself. Historical upstream change history imported with the initial source tree remains in `NEWS.txt` and is not duplicated here.

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Renamed the component to Boot across maintained documentation and integration metadata.
- Archived imported package definitions as source provenance so the current product cannot publish under the historical upstream package identity.
- Recorded InfiltratorOS's shared graphical product contract and emergency-only terminal policy.
- Reframed the repository around Boot as the product authority rather than its historical source basis.
- Added project-specific engineering, design, architecture, product-quality, safety, validation and provenance documentation under the canonical Infiltrator Engineering Philosophy.
- Added maintained build and contribution guidance.
- Defined inherited names and source structure as transitional implementation details rather than product identity.
- Reworked vendored InfiltratorFS maintenance so generation is explicit and CI verifies committed source instead of authoring and pushing source changes automatically.
- Tightened InfiltratorFS UEFI CI around explicit qualification semantics and immutable action identity.
